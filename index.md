## Welcome to Meetup World

This is the status page for the project.

### Project Status

Started August 23, 2021

This page was created as of today, and we have an idea, and some more background

Meetup.com search has gone from bad to worse. Things are gone and searches return no results. Events are randomly displayed in local and remote timezones. Searches does not include meetups outside meetup.com.

We registered https://meetup.world to be a global search and browse gateway to meetup.com AND other events, and are looking for volunteers to build a team, for the good of the world.

"We" are a group of you and others like you who want to make the meetup.world a reality, and are looking for others like you, who want to contribute.

We are looking for people like you to contribute. Everything from product owner to developer to tester, or what every you want call yourself.
